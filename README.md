# UCTImplementation

This repository is an implementation of the UCT algorithm on a multi-armed bandit problem. 

The Implementation of the algorithm is based off of the POMCP algorithm with modification to 
work on MDPs. 


Note: Python Code is working just fine 

Currently having trouble importing cython modules into the main UCT module.
Have properly cythonized env and node, they compile just fine -> getting import/compilation errors when trying to do the same withUCT
