# UCTImplementation

This repository is an implementation of the UCT algorithm on a multi-armed bandit problem. 

The Implementation of the algorithm is based off of the POMCP algorithm with modification to 
work on MDPs. 


Note: Python Code is working just fine 
Note: Cython Code is also working as of now
